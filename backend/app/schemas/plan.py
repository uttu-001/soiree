schemas/plan.py — Pydantic request/response schemas for plan endpoints.

CONCEPT: Schemas vs Models — what's the difference?
-----------------------------------------------------
Models (models/event.py etc.) define the DATABASE shape — what gets
stored in Postgres. They map 1:1 to tables and columns.

Schemas (this file) define the API shape — what the client sends
and what we send back. They're used for:
  - Validating incoming request bodies
  - Shaping outgoing JSON responses
  - Auto-generating OpenAPI docs (the /docs page)

Often they overlap but they're kept separate because:
  - DB models have fields the API should never expose (internal IDs, timestamps)
  - API schemas have computed fields that don't exist in the DB
  - You might want different validation rules at the API vs DB layer

CONCEPT: Pydantic validation
------------------------------
When FastAPI receives a POST body, it passes it through the Pydantic
schema automatically. If any field fails validation (wrong type, out
of range, missing required field), FastAPI returns a 422 error with
a detailed explanation — before your code even runs.

Field(ge=1) means "greater than or equal to 1".
Field(le=100) means "less than or equal to 100".
These are enforced automatically.
