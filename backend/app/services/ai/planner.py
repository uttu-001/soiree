"""
services/ai/planner.py — Claude streaming plan generator.

CONCEPT: Streaming with Server-Sent Events (SSE)
--------------------------------------------------
Instead of waiting for the full plan to generate (could take 10-15 seconds),
we stream it token-by-token to the frontend as Claude writes it.

The flow:
  1. Frontend opens an EventSource connection to POST /api/v1/plans/generate
  2. FastAPI returns a StreamingResponse with media_type="text/event-stream"
  3. As Claude generates tokens, we yield them in SSE format: "data: <token>\n\n"
  4. Frontend receives each token, appends it to the UI in real time
  5. When done, we yield "data: [DONE]\n\n" as a signal to close

SSE format spec:
  data: <content>\n\n    ← each message ends with double newline
  data: [DONE]\n\n       ← sentinel value signals stream end

CONCEPT: The full pipeline
----------------------------
generate_plan() orchestrates 3 stages:

  Stage 1 — Parallel MCP calls (asyncio.gather)
    All relevant Swiggy APIs fire simultaneously.
    ~100-300ms depending on network.

  Stage 2 — Offer enrichment
    Live offers fetched and injected into the prompt context.
    ~50-100ms (also async).

  Stage 3 — Claude streaming
    Prompt sent to Claude claude-sonnet-4-20250514 with full MCP context.
    Response streams token-by-token back to the caller.
    ~3-8 seconds for a full plan.

CONCEPT: Anthropic Python SDK streaming
-----------------------------------------
The SDK provides client.messages.stream() as an async context manager.
Inside it, stream.text_stream is an async iterator yielding text chunks:

    async with client.messages.stream(...) as stream:
        async for text in stream.text_stream:
            yield text   # each text is 1-10 characters typically

We yield these chunks directly up the call chain to the SSE response.
