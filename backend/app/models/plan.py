models/plan.py — Plan database model.

CONCEPT: What a Plan stores
-----------------------------
A Plan is the AI's output for a given Event. It stores:
  1. Raw MCP data — what Swiggy returned for restaurants, products, slots
  2. AI-structured content — the timeline, health insight, cost breakdown
  3. Applied offers — which discounts were active at generation time
  4. Order confirmations — booking IDs after the agent places orders (Phase 2)

CONCEPT: Why store MCP data in the Plan?
-----------------------------------------
Once a plan is generated, we don't want to re-fetch from Swiggy every time
the user views it. We store the snapshot. This also means if a restaurant
gets delisted or a slot fills up between generation and ordering, we can
detect the mismatch at checkout (compare stored plan vs live re-fetch).

CONCEPT: PlanStatus as a state machine
----------------------------------------
The status field tracks the plan through a strict lifecycle:

  generating → ready → approved → ordering → confirmed
                                            ↘ failed

Each transition is triggered by a specific action:
  - generating: set when AI streaming starts
  - ready: set when streaming completes successfully
  - approved: set when user clicks "Confirm Plan"
  - ordering: set when order agent begins placing Swiggy orders
  - confirmed: set when all Swiggy order IDs are received
  - failed: set if any Swiggy order call fails (with error detail)

This state machine pattern is important for the agentic ordering in Phase 2 —
it lets us resume, retry, or rollback cleanly.
