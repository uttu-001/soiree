"""
models/event.py — Event database model and its enums.

CONCEPT: Enums in SQLModel
---------------------------
Python's Enum class creates a fixed set of allowed values for a field.
SQLModel stores these as strings in Postgres (VARCHAR).
Using enums instead of raw strings gives us:
  - Auto-validation: "house_partyyy" raises an error at the schema layer
  - IDE autocomplete and type safety throughout the codebase
  - Self-documenting code — the allowed values are explicit

CONCEPT: Event vs Plan
------------------------
An Event is the *intent* — what the user wants to organise.
A Plan is the *output* — what the AI generated for that event.
One Event can have multiple Plans (user can regenerate or tweak).
This separation lets us track edit history and compare plans.

CONCEPT: Storing guests as JSON string
---------------------------------------
Guests are a variable-length list of objects: [{name, dietary_tags}].
Rather than a separate `guests` table (which would need a foreign key,
join queries etc.), we store the whole list as a JSON string for Phase 1.
This is a pragmatic tradeoff — simpler to build, slightly harder to query.
We'd normalise this into a proper `event_guests` table in Phase 3
when we build group consensus mode.
