"""
database.py — Async database engine and session management.

CONCEPT: SQLModel + SQLAlchemy async
--------------------------------------
SQLModel is a library built on top of SQLAlchemy (the most popular Python ORM)
and Pydantic (Python's data validation library). It lets you define ONE class
that works as both a database table AND an API schema — no duplication.

We use the *async* version of SQLAlchemy because FastAPI is async-native.
Async means the server doesn't "block" (freeze) while waiting for a DB query —
it handles other requests in the meantime. Critical for performance when we're
also waiting on 3 Swiggy MCP calls simultaneously.

HOW A REQUEST FLOWS THROUGH THIS FILE:
  1. FastAPI starts → lifespan() in main.py calls init_db()
  2. init_db() creates all tables in Postgres if they don't exist
  3. Every API endpoint that needs DB access gets a session injected
     via FastAPI's Depends(get_session) system
  4. The session is automatically closed after each request

# A "pool" means we keep N connections open and reuse them across requests
# instead of opening a new connection for every single API call (expensive).
#
# echo=True in development prints every SQL query to the terminal —
# extremely useful for learning what SQLModel generates under the hood.
# Turned off in production to avoid log spam.

# pool_pre_ping=True: before using a connection from the pool, send a
# lightweight "ping" to check it's still alive. Prevents "connection closed"
# errors after the DB has been idle.

    FastAPI dependency that provides a database session per request.

    CONCEPT: FastAPI Dependency Injection
    --------------------------------------
    FastAPI has a built-in DI system. Any function parameter annotated with
    Depends(get_session) will automatically receive a fresh session:

        @router.get("/events")
        async def list_events(session: AsyncSession = Depends(get_session)):
            ...

    The `async with` here is a context manager — it guarantees the session
    is always closed after the request, even if an exception is raised.
    This prevents connection leaks.

    The `yield` turns this into a "generator dependency" — FastAPI runs
    everything before yield to set up, injects the value, then runs
    everything after yield for cleanup (like a try/finally).
