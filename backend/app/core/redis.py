redis.py — Async Redis client and connection management.

CONCEPT: What is Redis and why do we need it?
----------------------------------------------
Redis is an in-memory key-value store — think of it as a super-fast
dictionary that lives outside your app process and survives restarts.

We use Redis for three distinct purposes in Soirée:

  1. CACHING MCP responses
     Swiggy restaurant data doesn't change every second. Instead of hitting
     the Dineout MCP on every plan generation, we cache results with a TTL
     (time-to-live). Restaurant list: 1hr TTL. Menus: 30min. Offers: 5min
     (offers change fast — we never want to show a stale deal).

  2. SESSION STORAGE
     JWT tokens for logged-in users. Redis lets us invalidate sessions
     instantly (logout, security breach) — something you can't do with
     stateless JWTs alone.

  3. CELERY BROKER
     Celery (our background job system) needs a "broker" — a message queue
     where it puts tasks. Redis is the simplest and most common choice.
     When a user approves a plan, we push an "place_order" task to Redis,
     and a Celery worker picks it up asynchronously.

CONCEPT: Singleton pattern
--------------------------
We use a module-level `_redis_client` variable (a singleton) so we create
the connection pool ONCE when the app starts, not on every request.
Creating a new Redis connection on every API call would be slow and
wasteful — pools exist to be reused.
"""

import redis.asyncio as aioredis
from app.core.config import settings

# Module-level singleton — None until first get_redis() call.
# Underscore prefix (_) is a Python convention meaning "private to this module".
_redis_client: aioredis.Redis | None = None


async def get_redis() -> aioredis.Redis:
    """
    Return the shared Redis client, creating it on first call (lazy init).

    CONCEPT: Lazy initialisation
    ----------------------------
    We don't create the Redis connection at import time because the config
    (REDIS_URL) might not be loaded yet. Instead we create it on the first
    actual request — "lazy" because we defer work until it's needed.

    from_url() creates a connection pool under the hood. All async Redis
    operations (get, set, delete) are non-blocking — the event loop can
    handle other requests while waiting for Redis to respond.

    Usage in an endpoint:
        redis = await get_redis()
        cached = await redis.get("restaurant:mumbai")
        await redis.set("restaurant:mumbai", data, ex=3600)  # ex = TTL in seconds
    """

        _redis_client = aioredis.from_url(
            settings.REDIS_URL,

            decode_responses=True,  # return str instead of bytes
        )
    return _redis_client

    Cleanly close the Redis connection on application shutdown.

    Without this, the connection would be left open and the process
    might hang during shutdown.
